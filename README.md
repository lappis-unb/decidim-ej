EJ component extends Decidim's capabilities to allow it to collect users opinions. After
enabling and configuring the component, a participation page will be available. 
The voting system is composed of a subject, a list of comments about the subject and 
three vote options. The votes are send to EJ using its API.

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
gem "decidim-ej"
```

```bash
bundle
```
For local development, you can refer to [this repository](https://gitlab.com/pencillabs/brasilparticipativo/decidim-ej-site).
